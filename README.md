# üóÇÔ∏è Repository organization 

## Folder: _Results_
This folder contains the data from the distribution system model used for the simulations.

### - Subfolder: _Sensitivity Matrix_

This subfolder contains the voltage sensitivity matrix for the IEEE 4-node and 37-node feeder, considering all the load models analyzed in the paper.

- `active_sensitivity_4Bus_Pconst.csv`: Voltage sensitivity matrix due to active power injection for the IEEE 4-node feeder, considering loads as constant power model; 
- `reactive_sensitivity_4Bus_Pconst.csv`: Voltage sensitivity matrix due to reactive power injection for the IEEE 4-node feeder, considering loads as constant power model; 
- `active_sensitivity_37Bus_Pconst.csv`: Voltage sensitivity matrix due to active power injection for the IEEE 37-node feeder, considering loads as constant power model; 
- `reactive_sensitivity_37Bus_Pconst.csv`: Voltage sensitivity matrix due to reactive power injection for the IEEE 37-node feeder, considering loads as constant power model; 

### - Subfolder: _Voltage Estimation Error_

This subfolder contains the voltage estimation results for the IEEE 37-node feeder. Each file represents the data used to draw each of the paper's graphs.

### - Subfolder: _Maximum Allowable Injection Estimation_

This subfolder contains the Maximum Allowable Injection estimation results for the IEEE 37-node feeder. Each file represents the data used to draw each of the paper's graphs.
