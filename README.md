## Folder: _Results_
This folder contains the data from the distribution system model used for the simulations.

Please, consider the adopted bus IDs, that relates with the IEEE 37-node reference as it follows:

(Adopted Id/IEEEID): 1/701, 2/702, 3/703, 4/704, 5/705, 6/706, 7/707, 8/708, 9/709, 10/710, 11/711, 12/712, 13/713, 14/714, 15/718, 16/720, 17/722, 18/724, 19/725, 20/727, 21/728, 22/729, 23/730, 24/731, 25/732, 26/733, 27/734, 28/735, 29/736, 30/737, 31/738, 32/740, 33/741, 34/742, 35/744, 36/775, 37/799
        
### - Subfolder: _Computational Cost_
This subfolder contains the execution time for voltage estimation considering the proposed TJSM method and traditional power flow analysis, for the IEEE 4-node and 37-node feeder, for 1000 executions.

- `execution_time_4Bus.csv`: Execution time for the IEEE 4-node feeder; 
- `execution_time_37Bus.csv`: Execution time for the IEEE 37-node feeder;

The first column of the files is related to the execution time for the classical power flow simulation, and the second is related to the proposed TJSM method.

### - Subfolder: _Sensitivity Matrix_

This subfolder contains the voltage sensitivity matrix for the IEEE 4-node and 37-node feeder, considering all the load models analyzed in the paper.

- `(active/reactive)_sensitivity_(4/37)Bus_Zconst.csv`: Voltage sensitivity matrix due to active/reactive power injection for the IEEE 4/37-node feeder, considering loads as constant impedance model; 
- `(active/reactive)_sensitivity_(4/37)Bus_Iconst.csv`: Voltage sensitivity matrix due to active/reactive power injection for the IEEE 4/37-node feeder, considering loads as constant current model; 
- `(active/reactive)_sensitivity_(4/37)Bus_Pconst.csv`: Voltage sensitivity matrix due to active/reactive power injection for the IEEE 4/37-node feeder, considering loads as constant power model; 

### - Subfolder: _Voltage Estimation Error_

This subfolder contains the voltage estimation results for the IEEE 37-node feeder. Each file represents the data used to draw each of the paper's graphs.

For Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7, considering penetration scenarios Low (0), Medium (1) and High (2) and the phases numbering A (0), B (1) and C (2):

- `Fig_4_5.csv`: Data used to plot both Figures 4 and 5, related to the estimation error considering three penetration levels and unity power factor.
- `Fig_6_7.csv`: Data used to plot both Figures 6 and 7, related to the estimation error considering three penetration levels and power factor equals to 0.8. 

For Figure 8, considering the load models IDs 0 (Constant Impedance), 1 (Constant Current) and 2 (Constant Power):

- `Fig_8.csv`: Data used to plot Figure 8, related to the estimation error due to different load models.

For Figure 9, considering 0 if a voltage violation is not identified by both power flow and sensitivity methods, and 1 if identified.

- `Fig_9.csv`: Data used to plot Figure 9 relate to the estimation of the percentage of buses that different penetration levels lead to voltage violations.

For Figure 10:

- `Fig_10.csv`: Data used to plot Figure 10 relate to the estimation MAE for all combinations of double power injection in high sensitivity buses, for the IEEE 37 bus system.

### - Subfolder: _Maximum Allowable Injection Estimation_

This subfolder contains the Maximum Allowable Injection estimation results for the IEEE 37-node feeder. Each file represents the data used to draw each of the paper's graphs.
